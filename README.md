 "ChurnShield: A Customer Churn Prediction System for SyriaTel Telecommunications"

 
BUSINESS PROBLEM


Reducing Customer Churn for SyriaTel Telecommunications


SyriaTel, a leading telecommunications company, is facing a significant challenge with customer churn. The company loses a substantial amount of revenue due to customers discontinuing their services. In a highly competitive market, retaining existing customers is essential for the company's profitability and growth. SyriaTel is actively seeking a solution to predict and reduce customer churn to minimize financial losses and improve customer satisfaction.


The Business Objective:

The primary objective is to establish an advanced predictive model - "ChurnShield" - which can accurately foresee when a customer is likely to leave SyriaTel's services. By identifying these customers before they churn, the company can initiate targeted retention strategies to minimize churn, foster customer loyalty, and maximize revenue.
